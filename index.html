				<h2>Written Work</h2>
				<b>Coronal Mass Ejections</b>
				<p>This is my final paper for the concurrent enrollment course AOSC170: Introduction to Solar System Plasmas.
					It discusses the basics behind our understanding of Coronal Mass Ejections, how they erupt, evolve through interplanetary space, 
					and have the potential to interact with other magnetized objects. This paper concludes with a discussion of the effects
					CMEs and other solar eruptions can have on Earth's magnetic field and the repercussions of interaction.
				</p><br>
				<b>Anxiety and Fear: The Existential Crisis</b>
				<p>Final course paper for Honors Seminar 86: Anxiety and Fear. This was a self-chosen topic that discusses 
					the nature of anxiety and its relation and importance to human existence. I argue that anxiety 
					defines our existence, without it, we lack our connection to each other and the world. 
				</p><br>
				<b>Courage: The Capstone of Personal Growth</b>
				<p>This paper is a culmination of my quarter long research during the Honors Collegium 50 Course. 
					It includes my personal experience and research into the two types of courage that most 
					affect college students and how to implement these traits for academic and work oriented improvement.  
				</p><br>
				<b>The Urgent Need for a Solution with the Use of GM Crops</b>
				<p>Through the first quarter of my cluster course, Biotechnology and Society, we reenacted 
					the 2001 Convention over the African famine where we argued over the use of GM crops as a 
					solution to this health crisis. My paper is my position statement as the EU Regulator and anti-GMO proponent.   
				</p><br>
				<b>Roadmap Reflection: Subjective Truths</b>
				<p>TIn the Honors 50C Course, we have been reading the book Roadmap. Through reading this novel I 
					have begun to look at my progress and future under a different lense. This is my reflection 
					as to the idea of subjective truths and combinations of Foundations and Interests that I can 
					use to guide my future studies.
